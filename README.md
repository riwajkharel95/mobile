## The bike csv parser

I have used Java stream API to create a backend service to parse and solve this problem.
Once you run the main function of CSVparser it will run and print all the model counts and the top 3 
models in the console. The models that are most advertised are EC-5, Beryll, ET-9 EVO and dirt drifter 3000.
Additionally, i have also create a junit test for validation. 

Model Top 3 Count
EC-5 = 4
Beryll = 3
ET-9 EVO = 2
dirt drifter 3000 = 2

Steps
1. Unzip the file
2. Import the pom.xml and project
3. Go to src/main/java and run CSVparser class to print the results

Constraints

Even though i was very busy with Thesis and work, i gave my best within the limited time. Unit test needs minor changes.
If i had more time, i would have created a page to upload and display the result of the CSV using my frontend knowledge in 
Javascript and react. Hope i have completed the tasks. Thank you

Feedback

The challenge was a good exercise for me personally as a full stack developer.
